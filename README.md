# GEOG458 Lab 2. Geo-tagged Tweet Collection and Visualization

For this Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization lab, I decided to research the topic "Homelessness" using the key term "homeless" to find tweets from the past week (Jan 15,2023 - Jan 22, 2023).
I decided to use three different cities to compare the topic homelessness with each other. Los Angeles (34.0716715537413,-118.20946083535517), Richmond (37.54317320970113,-77.43283876923756), and Seattle (47.62039945423961,-122.30359179186148). 

I decided to make comparisons with these three specific cities because I wanted to compare one of the biggest cities with a homeless problem (Los Angeles), the city that I currently reside in and is known for its homeless problems in the state (Seattle), and a city with a low amount of homeless people (Richmond). With Richmond with less than a 1000 known homeless population, Seattle with a homeless population around 11,000 people, and Los Angeles with a homeless population around 63,000 people, I wanted to see if the word clouds would be extremely different from each other or not. 

Looking at these word clouds, we can see that all 3 word clouds share some similar words such as "drugs", "owner", "hose", "POTUS", and even "death", "died", or "dead". Even though they all share these words, they seem to have a different priority in these cities since the word drugs is moderately big in Los Angeles and Seattle but in Richmond, it is extremely tiny and hard to even find. It makes us wonder if drugs are more of a problem in these bigger cities or if users are just trying to find something to blame towards homelessness. In Los Angeles's word cloud, we see that the biggest word is "MayorOfLA" followed with words such as "Help" and "Money" which gives us sort of an insight on how users are possibily either blaming and criticizing the Mayor of LA for this homelessness crisis or sking for help from the Mayor, whatever the case is, the Mayor of LA is a huge figure and key term in this topic. In Seattle's wortd cloud, we see more words such as "home", "encampment", "shelter", "house", and "owner" possibly due to the prices of a place being extremely expensive and Seattle's homeless camping ban law thats being enforced in these encampment areas which can be tied in with the word "Police" as well that appears in the word cloud. Even though the other cities' word clouds also have the word "drugs" in them, Seattle seems to have extra words for the specific type of drugs as well such as "Fentanyl" as well with words such as "crime". Seattle seems to have a bigger drug problem compared to the other two cities. In Richmond's word cloud, it seems that they have more words relating to race and gender such as "black", "white", "man", and "woman" along with words such as "cops", "arrest", "owner", and "business". A lot of assumptions can be made out from these words such as business owners are calling the cops on homeless people since they're being a problem outside their business or it can even be a race thing where more black people are getting targetted and arrrested. What ever the case is, the word "arrest" is huge in the Richmond's word cloud and completely different compared to the first two cities

This research definitely can be improved in the future by looking at more different time periods of the topic "Homelessness" and somehow try to make sense of the situation of specific words. For example, the word "Death" could be due to different situations such as people tweeting about them worrying over homeless people dying or there can even be tweets of people worrying that they'll die because a homeless person might attack them due to possibly a bad stigma towards homeless people. 

Before doing this lab assignment, I did not expect these cities to have so much in common such as having the same words such as drugs and POTUS. What I expected most was people were going to blame their local governemnt for the crisis such as Los Angeles biggest word being "MayorOfLA" but I didn't see that from Richmond's word cloud at all while Seattle had a "MayorOfSeattle" word but it was extremely tiny compared to Los Angeles. It seems like drugs and the President are a huge conversation in this topic of homelessness and although I don't know the specifics, I can only assume that they're blaming them for the homelessness crisis.
