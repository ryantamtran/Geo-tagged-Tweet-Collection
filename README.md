# GEOG458 Lab 2. Geo-tagged Tweet Collection and Visualization

For this Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization lab, I decided to research the topic "Homelessness" using the key term "homeless" to find tweets from the past week (Jan 15,2023 - Jan 22, 2023).
I decided to use three different cities to compare the topic homelessness with each other. Los Angeles (34.0716715537413,-118.20946083535517), Richmond (37.54317320970113,-77.43283876923756), and Seattle (47.62039945423961,-122.30359179186148). 

I decided to make comparisons with these three specific cities because I wanted to compare one of the biggest cities with a homeless problem (Los Angeles), the city that I currently reside in and is known for its homeless problems in the state (Seattle), and a city with a low amount of homeless people (Richmond). With Richmond with less than a 1000 known homeless population, Seattle with a homeless population around 11,000 people, and Los Angeles with a homeless population around 63,000 people, I wanted to see if the word clouds would be extremely different from each other or not. 

Looking at these word clouds, we can see that all 3 word clouds share some similar words such as "drugs", "owner", "hose", "POTUS", and even "death", "died", or "dead". Even though they all share these words, they seem to have a different priority in these cities since the word drugs is moderately big in Los Angeles and Seattle but in Richmond, it is extremely tiny and hard to even find. It makes us wonder if drugs are more of a problem in these bigger cities or if users are just trying to find something to blame towards homelessness. In Los Angeles's word cloud, we see that the biggest word is "MayorOfLA" followed with words such as "Help" and "Money" which gives us sort of an insight on how users are possibily either blaming and criticizing the Mayor of LA for this homelessness crisis or sking for help from the Mayor, whatever the case is, the Mayor of LA is a huge figure and key term in this topic. 

Looking at these word clouds, we can see that they all include the words homeless and people but that's where the similarities starts to end and each word clouds starts having more different common words being used. In Richmond's word cloud, you can see words such as "Food", "Home", "Billions", "Dollars", and "Problem" which might be because most people from that place are tweeting about maybe how they can focus more on possibily using the government's billions of dollars to provide food and a home for the homelessness problem. This is very different when looking at Seattke's word cloud which includes the words "Death", "Died", "County", "Shelter", and "Need" possibly because people are more worried about homeless people dying in this harsh winter condiiton and that the county needs more shelters. The last word cloud, Los Angeles, has words such as "Drug", "Money", and "Shelter" which could possibly be due to people thinking that there's a drug problem out in the streets and not enough money for shelters.

This research definitely can be improved in the future by looking at more different time periods of the topic "Homelessness" and somehow try to make sense of the situation of specific words. For example, the word "Death" could be due to different situations such as people tweeting about them worrying over homeless people dying or there can even be tweets of people worrying that they'll die because a homeless person might attack them due to possibly a bad stigma towards homeless people.
