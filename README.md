# GEOG458 Lab 2. Geo-tagged Tweet Collection and Visualization

For this Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization lab, I decided to research the topic "Homelessness" using the key term "homeless" to find tweets from the past week (Jan 15,2023 - Jan 22, 2023).
I decided to use three different cities to compare the topic homelessness with each other. Los Angeles (34.0716715537413,-118.20946083535517), Richmond (37.54317320970113,-77.43283876923756), and Seattle (47.62039945423961,-122.30359179186148). 

I decided to make comparisons with these three specific cities because I wanted to compare one of the biggest cities with a homeless problem (Los Angeles), the city that I currently reside in and is known for its homeless problems in the state (Seattle), and a city with a low amount of homeless people (Richmond). With Richmond with less than a 1000 known homeless population, Seattle with a homeless population around 11,000 people, and Los Angeles with a homeless population around 63,000 people, I wanted to see if the word clouds would be extremely different from each other or not. 

Looking at these word clouds, we can see that they all include the words homeless and people but that's where the similarities starts to end and each word clouds starts having more different common words being used. In Richmond's word cloud, you can see words such as "Food", "Home", "Billions", "Dollars", and "Problem" which might be because most people from that place are tweeting about maybe how they can focus more on possibily using the government's billions of dollars to provide food and a home for the homelessness problem. This is very different when looking at Seattke's word cloud which includes the words "Death", "Died", "County", "Shelter", and "Need" possibly because people are more worried about homeless people dying in this harsh winter condiiton and that the county needs more shelters. The last word cloud, Los Angeles, has words such as "Drug", "Money", and "Shelter" which could possibly be due to people thinking that there's a drug problem out in the streets and not enough money for shelters.

4. compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds (5 PTS)
5. what might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed (5 PTS)
6. how your research could be improved in the future (5 PTS)
7. anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you (5 PTS)

Export the two or more word clouds to the repository and then insert them to the readme.md. (5 PTS)

The readme.md also needs to include a url to download the result spreadsheets (csv file) of the collected data (5 PTS).
